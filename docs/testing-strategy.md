# Testing Strategy — TDD is mandatory

## The rule

**No production code is written before a failing test exists for it.** Red → Green → Refactor, in that order, every time:

1. Write a test that expresses the behavior you're about to build. Watch it fail (red) — this proves the test actually tests something.
2. Write the minimum code to make it pass (green).
3. Refactor with the safety net of the passing test, re-run to confirm still green.

This applies to bug fixes too: reproduce the bug as a failing test first, then fix it. The test is what proves the bug is actually gone and stays gone.

Claude/any agent working in this repo must follow this loop — do not write a controller/service/component method and then "add tests after" as a separate step. If a task arrives without an existing test for the behavior being changed, write the test first.

## Toolchain

### Backend (.NET)

| Concern | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Test framework | **xUnit** | The de-facto standard for modern .NET Core; constructor-based DI for test fixtures; parallel by default. |
| Mocking | **Moq** | Most widely used .NET mocking library; isolates the unit under test from its dependencies. |
| Assertions | **FluentAssertions** | Readable, intention-revealing assertions (`result.Should().Be(...)`) over raw `Assert.Equal`. |
| Integration/API tests | **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing** (`WebApplicationFactory`) | Spins up the real pipeline in-memory against a test database. |

Structure: one test project per source project (`MyApp.Domain.Tests`, `MyApp.Application.Tests`, `MyApp.Api.IntegrationTests`, ...), mirroring the folder/namespace layout of what it tests.

Naming: `MethodUnderTest_Scenario_ExpectedResult` (e.g., `CreateContract_WhenEndDateBeforeStartDate_ThrowsValidationException`). Follow **Arrange-Act-Assert**, with the three sections visually separated (blank line or comment) in every test.

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

| Concern | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Test runner | **Vitest** | Fast, native ESM, drop-in Jest-compatible API for a Vite-based React app. |
| Component testing | **React Testing Library (RTL)** | Tests behavior from the user's perspective (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`), never by class name or test-id when a better query exists. |
| API mocking | **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** | Intercepts requests at the network layer — the component makes a real `fetch`/`axios` call that MSW intercepts, so the component under test never knows it's mocked. The 2026-standard replacement for hand-rolled `fetch` mocks. |

Same TDD loop as the backend, applied to components and hooks: write the RTL test describing what the user should see/do first, watch it fail, then build the component until it passes.

MSW setup convention: a `handlers.ts` file per feature holds the "happy path" responses most tests can rely on without extra setup; individual tests call `server.use(...)` only when testing an error/edge case. The same handlers double as fixtures for local dev and (later) Storybook, so the mock contract can't quietly drift from what tests assume.

Test naming mirrors the backend convention: describe behavior, not implementation — `"shows the contract-expiry banner when a contract ends within 7 days"`, not `"renders correctly"`.

**Test timeout is 15s** (`vite.config.ts`'s `test.testTimeout`), not Vitest's 5s default. Multi-step interactions (type several form fields, open an antd `Select`, wait for a mutation to round-trip through MSW) reliably passed in isolation but timed out at 5s when the *whole* suite ran together under load — this was a real flaky-test cause, not a logic bug, confirmed by running the failing file alone (green) vs. the full suite (red). If a new test times out only under the full-suite run, suspect load/timing before suspecting the test's logic.

**Backend integration tests share one disposable database across every test class in a single `dotnet test` run** (it's uniquely-named and dropped afterward — not persisted across runs — but *within* one run, `Create`/`Update` tests across different methods, even different test classes, all write to the same tables). Don't reuse a fixed literal value (e.g. a title string) across multiple test methods for an entity with a uniqueness constraint (`ReferenceListItemEntityConfiguration`'s `(Kind, Title)` unique index is a real example) — two methods creating the identical value collide with a `DbUpdateException` → 500, which then fails confusingly at the *next* line (an `EnsureSuccessStatusCode`/`ReadFromJsonAsync` call), not at the insert itself. Generate distinct values per test (e.g. suffix with `Guid.NewGuid()`) whenever a test creates data under a uniquely-constrained field.

## What must have tests

- Every service/use-case class in the Application layer (business rules — contracts expiring, checklist validation, task assignment, etc.).
- Every controller action's contract (status code, shape of response) via integration tests — not necessarily every branch, that's the service layer's job.
- Every non-trivial React component with logic (forms, checklist builder, dynamic list rendering) — not pure presentational components with no branching.

## What doesn't need a dedicated test

- Simple DTOs/records with no logic.
- Framework wiring (`Program.cs` startup) — covered indirectly by integration tests actually running.

## Before every commit or push

Tests must be green locally. See the repo's git workflow in [git-and-github-setup.md](./git-and-github-setup.md) — `/code-review` runs *after* tests pass, not instead of them.
